Exploratory analysis
--------------------
Some item ids in `courses_num.txt` don't have an entry in the file
`courses_details.txt`. This means that we don't have any name, year or other
details about these courses. The following item ids have no course details:

```{r}
item.ids <- itemLabels(courses.tr)
indices <- which(sapply(item.ids, function(x) is.null(GetNameForItem(x))))
item.ids[indices]
```
So about `r length(item.ids[indices]) / length(item.ids)` of all items have no
name associated with them.
